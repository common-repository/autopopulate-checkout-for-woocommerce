Use your querystring to pass in values that can be used on your Woocommerce checkout to any page on your WordPress site.  When the keys are set the values will be associated with the corresponding WooCommerce checkout field.

== Description ==

Use this plugin to pass in values via the querystring to any page on your WordPress site, and they will be set in the Woocommerce Customer session for the life of the users time on your site. 

The values will then be prepopulated on the the Woocommerce checkout page and also available anywhere on your site by calling the Woocommerce Customer session get. 

All of the Billing and Shipping Fields can be passed in.
